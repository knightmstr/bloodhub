# BloodHub

BloodHub is part of the blood donor application we developed for our MIT-SE second semester unit PRT-452 of Charles Darwin University.

Our awesome team has four members; Dipak Bhattarai, Saugat Pathak, Prabhat Kumar Rauniyar and Sudip Poudel.

The repository contains all the codes for the whole system.

## About the RSC Hackathon

The Hackathon was held on the 22nd and 23rd of november 2014. The task (a blood donor system) was revealed at the beginning of the hackathon and all the teams were given 24 hours to design and implement the system and to create a short presentation about the implemented system.

After the 24 hours were up and everyone got a bit of sleep all the teams presented their implementations.
The organizers then graded the teams using a range of criteria and declared the winners.

## About the task

The task was to implement a blood donor system which consists of a web application and a mobile application.
The web application is used by donor institutions to manage their blood supply and send push notifications to donors.
The mobile app is used by donors to track their donations and encourage them to donate using gamification.
