# BloodHub

BloodHub is part of the blood donor application we developed for our MIT-SE second semester unit PRT-452 of Charles Darwin University.

Our awesome team has four members; Dipak Bhattarai, Saugat Pathak, Prabhat Kumar Rauniyar and Sudip Poudel.

The repository contains all the codes for the whole system.
